[GenericCA]
===========

Created by Pieter Steyaert [SUBTIV] for Open Frameworks. 
Ported to Processing by Mark C Mitchell [@zlot].

My initial goal was to gain understanding in Cellular Automata
and create a set of tools that could help me experiment with 
non-arbitrary complexity.
 
There are pre-written functions for up to 6 parameters, but
using the `<< bool checkTheRules(bool *params, int ruleNumber=noNewRule) >>` one can experiment with an unlimited amount of parameters.
 
 => The `setRuleNumberAnalog()` function is broken.
